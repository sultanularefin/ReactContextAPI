ESLint: 7.17.0

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin".

(The package "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "/home/taxi/Programs/reactCraftsMan".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@latest --save-dev

The plugin "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin" was referenced from the config file in "BaseConfig".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
